<h1>Maware Analysis using Deep Learning models provided by Microsoft Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015) | Kaggle</h1>
<b>Two-stage pre-execution detection on users computers with similarity hash mapping combined with decision trees ensemble.
To analyze files during the pre-execution stage, we combine
a similarity hashing approach with other trained algorithms in a two-stage
scheme. To train this model, we use a large collection of files that we know
to be malware and benign.<B>
